abstract = {We aim to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding Galactic Faraday rotation in an all-sky map of the Galactic Faraday depth. For this we have assembled the most extensive catalog of Faraday rotation data of compact extragalactic polarized radio sources to date. In the map-making procedure we used a recently developed algorithm that reconstructs the map and the power spectrum of a statistically isotropic and homogeneous field while taking into account uncertainties in the noise statistics. This procedure is able to identify some rotation angles that are offset by an integer multiple of $\pi$. The resulting map can be seen as an improved version of earlier such maps and is made publicly available, along with a map of its uncertainty. For the angular power spectrum we find a power law behavior C$\ell$ $\propto$ $\ell$-2.17 for a Faraday sky where an overall variance profile as a function of Galactic latitude has been removed, in agreement with earlier work. We show that this is in accordance with a 3D Fourier power spectrum P(k) $\propto$ k-2.17 of the underlying field neBr under simplifying geometrical and statistical assumptions.},

While previous   studies have focussed on either the variation of the emissivity on   large ( {\textasciitilde}  kpc) scales, or on fluctuations due to MHD turbulence   in the interstellar medium, we unify these approaches to match the  angular power spectrum. We note that the usual turbulence cascade  calculation ignores spatial correlations at the injection scale  ( {\textasciitilde} 100 pc) due to compression of the interstellar medium by of  (1000) old supernova remnants {\textemdash} the `radio loops' only  four of which are visible in radio maps. This new component  naturally provides the otherwise missing power on intermediate and  small scales in the all-sky map at 408 MHz. Our model can enable more reliable subtraction of the synchrotron foreground for studies  of CMB anisotropies or searches for dark matter annihilation. We  conclude with some remarks on the relevance to modelling of the  polarised foreground.},

abstract = {We extend previous work modelling the Galactic magnetic field in the plane using synchrotron emission in total and polarized intensity. In this work, we include a more realistic treatment of the cosmic ray electrons using the GALPROP propagation code optimized to match the existing high-energy data. This addition reduces the degeneracies in our previous analysis and when combined with an additional observed synchrotron frequency allows us to study the low-energy end of the cosmic ray electron spectrum in a way that has not previously been done. For a pure diffusion propagation, we find a low-energy injection spectrum slightly harder than generally assumed: for J(E) $\propto$E$\alpha$, we find $\alpha$=-1.34 {\textpm} 0.12, implying a very sharp break with the spectrum above a few GeV. This then predicts a synchrotron brightness temperature spectral index, $\beta$, on the Galactic plane, that is -2.8 < $\beta$ < -2.74 below a few GHz and -2.98 < $\beta$ < -2.91 up to 23 GHz. We find that models including cosmic ray re-acceleration processes appear to be incompatible with the synchrotron data.},

abstract = {We study the scattering of low-energy Cosmic Rays (CRs) in a turbulent, compressive MHD fluid. We show that compressible MHD modes -- fast or slow waves with wave lengths smaller than CR mean free paths induce cyclotron instability in CRs. The instability feeds the new small-scale Alfvenic wave component with wave vectors mostly along magnetic field, which is not a part of the MHD turbulence cascade. This new component gives feedback on the instability through decreasing the CR mean free path. We show that the ambient turbulence fully suppresses the instability at large scales, while wave steepening constrains the amplitude of the waves at small scales. We provide the energy spectrum of the plane-parallel Alfvenic component and calculate mean free paths of CRs as a function of their energy. We find that for the typical parameters of turbulence in the interstellar medium and in the intercluster medium the new Alfvenic component provides the scattering of the low energy CRs that exceeds the direct resonance scattering by MHD modes. This solves the problem of insufficient scattering of low-energy CRs in the turbulent interstellar or intracluster medium that was reported in the literature.},
