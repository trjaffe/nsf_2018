abstract = {We discuss new methods to integrate the cosmic ray (CR) evolution equations coupled to magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) on an unstructured moving mesh, as realised in the massively parallel AREPO code for cosmological simulations. We account for diffusive shock acceleration of CRs at resolved shocks and at supernova remnants in the interstellar medium (ISM), and follow the advective CR transport within the magnetised plasma, as well as anisotropic diffusive transport of CRs along the local magnetic field. CR losses are included in terms of Coulomb and hadronic interactions with the thermal plasma. We demonstrate the accuracy of our formalism for CR acceleration at shocks through simulations of plane-parallel shock tubes that are compared to newly derived exact solutions of the Riemann shock tube problem with CR acceleration. We find that the increased compressibility of the post-shock plasma due to the produced CRs decreases the shock speed. However, CR acceleration at spherically expanding blast waves does not significantly break the self-similarity of the Sedov-Taylor solution; the resulting modifications can be approximated by a suitably adjusted, but constant adiabatic index. In first applications of the new CR formalism to simulations of isolated galaxies and cosmic structure formation, we find that CRs add an important pressure component to the ISM that increases the vertical scale height of disk galaxies, and thus reduces the star formation rate. Strong external structure formation shocks inject CRs into the gas, but the relative pressure of this component decreases towards halo centres as adiabatic compression favours the thermal over the CR pressure.},

abstract = {The orientations of filamentary molecular clouds in the Gould Belt and their local ICM (inter-cloud media) magnetic fields are studied using near-infrared dust extinction maps and optical stellar polarimetry data. These filamentary clouds are a few-to-ten parsecs in length, and we find that their orientations tend to be either parallel or perpendicular to the mean field directions of the local ICM. This bimodal distribution is not found in cloud simulations with super-Alfvenic turbulence, in which the cloud orientations should be random. ICM magnetic fields that are dynamically important compared to inertial-range turbulence and self-gravity can readily explain both field-filament configurations. Previous studies commonly recognize that strong magnetic fields can guide gravitational contraction and result in filaments perpendicular to them, but few discuss the fact that magnetic fields can also channel sub-Alfvenic turbulence to form filaments aligned with them. This strong-field scenario of cloud formation is also consistent with the constant field strength observed from ICM to clouds (Crutcher et al. 2010) and is possible to explain the "hub-filament" cloud structure (Myers 2009) and the density threshold of cloud gravitational contraction (Kainulainen et al. 2009).},

abstract = {Understanding star formation rates (SFR) is a central goal of modern star-formation models, which mainly involve gravity, turbulence and, in some cases, magnetic fields (B-fields). However, a connection between B-fields and SFR has never been observed. Here, a comparison between the surveys of SFR and a study of cloud-field alignment - which revealed a bimodal (parallel or perpendicular) alignment - shows consistently lower SFR per solar mass for clouds almost perpendicular to the B-fields. This is evidence of B-fields being a primary regulator of SFR. The perpendicular alignment possesses a significantly higher magnetic flux than the parallel alignment and thus a stronger support of the gas against self-gravity. This results in overall lower masses of the fragmented components, which are in agreement with the lower SFR.},

abstract = {The quest for the elusive dark matter (DM) that permeates the Universe (and in general the search for signatures of Physics beyond the Standard Model at astronomical scales) provides a unique opportunity and a tough challenge to the high-energy astrophysics community. In particular, the so-called DM indirect searches - mostly focused on a class of theoretically well-motivated DM candidates such as the weakly-interacting massive particles - are affected by a complex astrophysical background of cosmic radiation. The understanding and modeling of such background requires a deep comprehension of an intricate classical plasma physics problem, i.e. the interaction between high-energy charged particles, accelerated in peculiar astrophysical environments, and magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence in the interstellar medium of our Galaxy. In this review we highlight several aspects of this exciting interplay between the most recent claims of DM annihilation/decay signatures from the sky and the Galactic cosmic-ray research field. Our purpose is to further stimulate the debate about viable astrophysical explanations, discussing possible directions that would help breaking degeneracy patterns in the interpretation of current data. We eventually aim to emphasize how a deep knowledge on the physics of CR transport is therefore required to tackle the DM indirect search program at present and in the forthcoming years.},

abstract = {We explore the possible signatures of dark matter (DM) pair annihilations in the nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxy Draco. After investigating the mass models for Draco in the light of available observational data, we carefully model the DM density profile, taking advantage of numerical simulations of hierarchical structure formation. We then analyze the gamma-ray and electron/positron yield expected for weakly interacting DM particle (WIMP) models, including an accurate treatment of the propagation of the charged particle species. We show that unlike in larger DM structures - such as galaxy clusters - spatial diffusion plays here an important role. While Draco would appear as a point-like gamma-ray source, synchrotron emission from electrons and positrons produced by WIMP annihilations features a spatially extended structure. Depending upon the cosmic ray propagation setup and the size of the magnetic fields, the search for a diffuse radio emission from Draco can be a more sensitive indirect DM search probe than gamma rays. Finally, we show that available data are consistent with the presence of a black hole at the center of Draco: if this is indeed the case, very significant enhancements of the rates for gamma rays and other emissions related to DM annihilations are expected.},

Interpreting synchrotron emission data requires knowledge of the cosmic ray number density, which is often assumed to be in energy equipartition (or otherwise tightly correlated) with the magnetic field energy. However, there is no compelling observational or theoretical reason to expect such tight correlation to hold across all scales. We use test particle simulations, tracing the propagation of charged particles (protons) through a random magnetic field, to study the cosmic ray distribution at scales comparable to the correlation scale of the turbulent flow in the interstellar medium ({\$}\backslashsimeq 100\backslash,{\{}\backslashrm pc{\}}{\$} in spiral galaxies). In these simulations, we find that there is no spatial correlation between the cosmic ray number density and the magnetic field energy density. In fact, their distributions are approximately statistically independent. We find that low-energy cosmic rays can become trapped between magnetic mirrors, whose location depends more on the structure of the field lines than on the field strength.},

Such fields are usually highly intermittent, consisting of intense magnetic filaments and ribbons surrounded by weaker, unstructured fluctuations. Studies of cosmic ray propagation have largely overlooked intermittency, instead relying on Gaussian random magnetic fields. Using test particle simulations, we investigate cosmic ray diffusivity in intermittent, dynamo-generated magnetic fields. The results are compared with those obtained from non-intermittent magnetic fields having identical power spectra. The presence of magnetic intermittency significantly enhances cosmic ray diffusion over a wide range of particle energies. We demonstrate that the results can be interpreted in terms of a correlated random walk.},

Even though the main interaction processes are identified, more and more precise observations provide an opportunity to study more subtle effects and pose a challenge to the propagation models. GALPROP is a sophisticated CR propagation code that is being developed for about 20 years. It provides a unified framework for interpretations of data from many different types of experiments. It is used for a description of direct CR measurements and associated interstellar emissions (radio to gamma rays), thereby providing important information about CR injection and propagation in the interstellar medium. By accounting for all relevant observables at a time, the GALPROP code brings together theoretical predictions, interpretation of the most recent observations, and helps to reveal the signatures of new phenomena. In this paper we review latest applications of GALPROP and address ongoing and near future improvements. We are discussing effects of different propagation models, and of the transition from cylindrically symmetrical models to a proper 3D description of the components of the interstellar medium and the source distribution.},
